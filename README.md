# Text-Emotions-Classification
Text emotions classification is the problem of assigning emotion to a text by understanding the context and the emotion behind the text. One real-world example is the keyboard of an iPhone that recommends the most relevant emoji by understanding the text.
# Introduction
Text emotions classification is the problem of natural language processing and text classification. Here we need to train a text classification model to classify the emotion of a text. To solve this problem, we need labelled data of texts and their emotions. I found an ideal dataset to solve this problem on Kaggle. Now we need to pad the sequences to the same length to feed them into a neural network. We are now going to One-hot encode the labels. One hot encoding refers to the transformation of categorical labels into a binary representation where each label is represented as a vector of all zeros except a single 1. This is necessary because machine learning algorithms work with numerical data.
